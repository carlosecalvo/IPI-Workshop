# IPI-Workshop

This repository is a set of slideshows meant as introduction to *R* and its capabilities. It was originally presented to my coleagues of the Institute for Policy Integrity, starting in December 2018.

It's still a work in progress and it's divided in weeks. Where almost every week is a new topic.
